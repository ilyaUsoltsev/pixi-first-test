Severity Assessment: 6/10 (Moderate Issues)
It wasn't terrible, but it had some real problems that would bite you as the project grew:
Critical Issues (Would cause bugs in production):
Memory Leak in Sprite.move() - 8/10 severity
// OLD CODE - Every time move() is called
this.app.ticker.add(() => { ... }); // NEVER REMOVED!
Calling move() twice would add 2 ticker callbacks
Destroy the sprite? Ticker still running
Create 100 entities? 100 callbacks running forever
Result: Progressive slowdown, eventual crash
Callback Hell in PathManager - 5/10 severity
// OLD CODE - Nested callbacks, hard to handle errors
pathManager.findPath(start, end, (path) => {
  if (path) { ... }
}, () => { ... });
No way to properly await pathfinding
Error handling was awkward
Couldn't compose async operations easily
Medium Issues (Bad practices, but wouldn't break immediately):
No Input Validation - 6/10 severity
PathManager would accept out-of-bounds coordinates
Would fail deep in easystar with cryptic errors
Hard to debug "why is pathfinding broken?"
Poor Separation of Concerns - 5/10 severity
main.ts knew too much about implementation details
Hard to test anything
Couldn't easily add new features
Generic Naming ("Sprite") - 3/10 severity
Name collision with PixiJS's Sprite class
Not semantically meaningful for a game entity
Confusing for new developers
Minor Issues (Just messy):
Magic Numbers Everywhere - 2/10 severity
Colors hardcoded as 0xffff00
Speed values scattered around
Config would be needed eventually anyway
No Cleanup Methods - 4/10 severity
GameScene couldn't properly tear down
Testing would be painful
Scene transitions would leak resources
Real-World Impact:
If you shipped this to production:
✅ Would work initially - Yes, fine for a demo
⚠️ After 5 minutes of gameplay - Noticeable slowdown from ticker leak
❌ After 30 minutes - Game becomes unplayable
❌ On level restart - Memory keeps growing
❌ Adding more features - Tech debt compounds quickly
What You Did Right:
To be fair, the original code had good bones:
✅ Proper manager pattern
✅ Reasonable separation of rendering/logic/data
✅ Used TypeScript
✅ Clean file structure
Verdict: It was prototype-quality code that needed production hardening. Perfect for learning, but the memory leak would've been discovered in QA testing. The refactoring moves it from "works on my machine" to "ready for a real game."
